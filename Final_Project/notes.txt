Fig. 7(b) shows that r2 has no 
effect on R_0, as my method predicts
-WHY? b/c would not be fast enough
to effect wholly susceptible population?
--rehab process is long as it is, let alone
enough time to regress back to heavy use
--but then why r1 matter?


CHANGE IN PAPER:
m=4 now, not m=3

z state var, crystal meth density, is considered like an epidemiological VECTOR

Extensions:
-explain why my NGM does not work and theirs does + intuition
-simulate with z=0
-simplify by removing x equation
-try non-per-capita expression for policing
--LOGISTIC GROWTH makes no sense, would add to drug supply at times.
--Michaelis-Menten-style saturation, b/c police only have so many
resources
---greatly changes bifurcation value R_0?
--Diffusion? No, bc specific to one province, drug supplies not very mobile 
--according to paper?

-weird, complex conjugate in eigenvalues

-slow n fast dynamics, s through y equilibrate faster than z b/c
small alphas and nu


R_0 and R_1+R_2+R_3 differ my constant 0.1083598, 0.156


RISE OF CRYSTAL METH IN SOUTH AFRICA'S WESTERN CAPE
SIMILARITY TO EPIDEMIOLOGY
THE STATE VARIABLES
THE MODEL, BRIEFLY
-asymmetrical person-supply contacts?
-NONDIM'D
-----
Next-generation Matrix, lil course in how it works
Quasi-steady state analysis/ slow timescale for drug density equation
Contour Plots to see effect of parameters on R_0
-makes sense that r1 increases R0 more than r2 does
-----
Retrying next-gen matrix, failure, why?
Conditional policing
Saturating policing to model finite resources
-saturates with respect to drugs(z), heavy users(w) [wiggles?], 
both light and heavy
--WOWEE ZOWEEE, the NGM with saturating policing turns out quite nicely
---quotient rule, eval at DFE, just get z_max/k_m
--quasi-steady-state analysis with saturating policing
Does it make sense for a per cap recovery rate >1?? No, because that
-would produce more quitters/recoveries than there are infected at a given time!!!
--this explains why in numeric simulations, y(quitters) get so high while
-- users v and w stay nearly 0

Actually got some small complex conjugates in Jacobian eval at DFE???
-------
EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WITH CONTOUR PLOTS, GGPLOT2 THO?????


THETA_2 increases R_0, with others held constant
-matches the paper's findings in contour plots and numerical attempts
--however, paper is straaaaangely silent on this
--READ A QUOTATION ON THEIR ANALYSIS OF THIS PHENOMENON TO PAD TIME, YO

Saturating policing does exactly what my intuition would have told me;
-a lot like most units in this course, many symbols/equations boil down to 
what you'd expect
